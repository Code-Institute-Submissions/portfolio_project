### Testing of all features on site

* Whole site features

1. Header
    * Go to **Homepage** of site on mobile device and navigate to and between **Projects**, **Resume** and **Blog** pages by pressing the hamburger icon and using the links in the top right dropdown menu. 
    *A bug was found here on mobile Chrome and Safari browsers using iPhone SE: the contact button and hamburger icon are elongated and the text in the content button is not centered. Tried to fix, but requires connecting iphone to mac and using web inspector tool to identify cause. I do not have a mac easily available so this fix was left for later as it does not affect function of header*  
    * Confirm that the hamburger icon opens and collapses the dropdown menu and all the links in the dropdown menu direct to correct pages and display box shadow transition when pressed.
    *The buttons all work correctly but the effects when links are pressed are not as intended and as shown in chrome dev tools. As above, this bug does not affect function and user feedback is still provided so fix left for later when required tools are available.*
