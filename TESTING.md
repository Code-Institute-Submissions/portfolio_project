### Testing of all features on site

* Whole site features

1. Header
    a. Go to **Homepage** of site on mobile device and navigate to and between **Projects**, **Resume** and **Blog** pages by pressing the hamburger icon and using the links in the top right dropdown menu. 
    *A bug was found here on mobile Chrome and Safari browsers using iPhone SE: the contact button and hamburger icon are elongated and the text in the content button is not centered. Tried to fix, but requires connecting iphone to mac and using web inspector tool to identify cause. I do not have a mac easily available so this fix was left for later as it does not affect function of header*  
    b. Confirm that the hamburger icon opens and collapses the dropdown menu and all the links in the dropdown menu direct to correct pages and display box shadow transition when pressed.
    *The buttons all work correctly but the effects when links are pressed are not as intended and as shown in chrome dev tools. As above, this bug does not affect function and user feedback is still provided so fix left for later when required tools are available.*
    c. Confirm that the text of the current page link in the drop down menu is bold. 
    d. Confirm that the contact button triggers full page contact form modal to appear and the background to the modal is dimmed.

    f. Confirm that the header remains fixed to the top of the viewport at all times and is slightly translucent as page is scrolled down. 
    g. On a tablet device, go to **Homepage** of site and navigate to and between **Projects**, **Resume** and **Blog** pages using the row of links.
    *Same bug as above with styling of links in header - fix left to later*
    h. Confirm that row of links occupies over half of horizontal space in header and that links are equally sized and do not overlap each other or outside the header.

Confirm that the navlinks collapse to a **hamburger icon** and **Contact** link at the appropriate breakpoint.
