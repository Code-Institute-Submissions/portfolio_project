### Owner's goals

The owner's (my) goals for the site:

* to present my skills, experience, qualifications and abilities in a clear, convenient, professional format to potential
employers and clients. 
* to provide a clear, positive and satisfying user interface and experience to all users of the site and help establish a positive reputation for myself as
a developer and web designer with front end skills.
* to provide a convenient way for potential employers/clients/collaborators/developers to contact me so that I increase job opportunities, expand my network and  industry connections.
* to present my projects to potential colaborators and other developers so I increase my following and connections and receive more feedback and suggestions.
* to present a selection of my blog posts primarily to other developers with a similar level of skills
and experience to me so that I contribute in a small way to help others learn and grow and I benefit myself 
through comments and interactions.
* to evidence my accomplished communication and design skills so I am more likely to be hired or recommended for projects. 

This site facilitates the realisation of these owner's goals better than alternatives by:

* displaying relevant information to users while simultaneously showcasing my design and front-end development skills.
* collating all aspects of my professional online presence and directing users on clear paths to relevant information through efficient navigation.
* providing a richer, more engaging, more personalized exposition of my professional credentials, interests and personality than 
a proforma resume hosting site or document.

### User goals

* potential employer/client looking to hire a junior developer - wants to assess my skills and experience
quickly, get an impression of my ability and areas of strength/weakness, find relevant information about 
qualifications, view my projects and contact me easily.
* potential collaborator looking to work with a junior developer with relevant skills and experience to their needs -
wants to assess my skills and experience quickly, view my previous projects and contact me easily.
* coding student/learner/enthusiast looking for blog posts relevant to their experience and knowledge levels - 
wants to choose from and view my blog posts easily.
* other developers who may want to follow me on GitHub or otherwise connect - want to view a summary of my projects
and link to them easily on GitHub: may also want to contact me to connect. 

This site facilitates the realisation of these various user's goals better than alternatives by:
