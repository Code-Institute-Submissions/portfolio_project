### Owner's goals

The owner's (my) goals for the site:

* to present my skills, experience, qualifications and abilities in a clear, convenient, professional format to potential
employers and clients. 
* to provide a clear, positive and satisfying user interface and experience to all users of the site and help establish a positive reputation for myself as
a developer and web designer with front end skills.
* to provide a convenient way for potential employers/clients/collaborators/developers to contact me so that I increase job opportunities, expand my network and  industry connections.
* to present my projects to potential colaborators and other developers so I increase my following and connections and receive more feedback and suggestions.
* to present a selection of my blog posts primarily to other developers with a similar level of skills
and experience to me so that I contribute in a small way to help others learn and grow and I benefit myself 
through comments and interactions.
* to evidence my accomplished communication and design skills so I am more likely to be hired or recommended for projects. 

This site facilitates the realisation of these owner's goals better than alternatives by:

* displaying relevant information to users while simultaneously showcasing my design and front-end development skills.
* collating all aspects of my professional online presence and directing users on clear paths to relevant information through efficient navigation.
* providing a richer, more engaging, more personalized exposition of my professional credentials, interests and personality than 
a proforma resume hosting site or document.

### User goals

The goals of various site users are:

* potential employer/client looking to hire a junior developer - wants to assess my skills and experience
quickly, get an impression of my ability and areas of strength/weakness, find relevant information about 
qualifications, view my projects and contact me easily.
* potential collaborator looking to work with a junior developer with relevant skills and experience to their needs -
wants to assess my skills and experience quickly, view my previous projects and contact me easily.

### Site map (navigation overview)

* All pages navigate to all other pages directly through navigation links in fixed header. 
* All pages navigate to external (Medium, GitHub, Linkedin) links via footer. 
* Home and resume pages include link to download resume.pdf file.
* Blog and projects pages contain numerous external links to individual posts and project repositories.

### Features across whole site

* [Header](index.html) - fixed height and fixed to top of viewport over other content on all pages and view sizes. Includes familiar top left site logo which links back to index.html and top right responsive navigation menu. 
Navigation menu includes links to Home, Projects, Blog and Resume pages; and a Contact button that opens a modal containing a contact form (described below).
All navigation links (except logo icon) provide user feedback: a background-color transition hover effect and a boxshadow active effect when pressed/clicked.
Current page (active link) has a bold font to remind the user of their current location on the site.
Navigation links in responsive navbar occupy right half of header area on desktop views, 66% on tablet views and collapse into a familiar top right 'hamburger' menu button with remaining adjacent contact link on mobile device sizes. Link heights scales subtly with viewport width on desktop views.
Hamburger menu drops down at top right of area below header when icon is pressed - dropdown menu contains links to Home, Projects, Blog and Resume pages which are styled consistently and provide consistent user feedback. 
Header provides a familiar and comfortable navigation experience to users and reassuring feedback when using navigation. Header allows user to reach all areas of site very easily for anywhere on the site.

* [Contact modal](index.html) - triggered by clicking/pressing Contact button that is present at top right of header on all view sizes.

Form has a submit button which triggers pop-ups next to input fields if requirements of form are not met, or if form meets requirements it triggers a browser alert to confirm form was usbmitted successfully and reloads page that modal was opened from. Sumbit button has a scale up hover effect and a box shadow active effect.
Modal has a footer containing location and email contact information for site owner.
Modal has a responsive layout - positioning of short input fields adjusts from single column on mobile to two column on desktop. Width of message input field increases with viewport width. 

* [Footer](index.html) - fixed height on all pages and view sizes. Dark background and smaller white font used to provide contrast and to visually identify 'aside' information.
Footer contains brief summary of location and copyright information at bottom left (serves as an 'about me').

Call to action provides direction for users who are more generally interested in finding out more about the owner, ratehr than looking for a specific thing. 
Call to action button is bold, has high contrast and scales up noticeably on hover to encourage user action. 
Jumbotron box size and font sizes scale change at specific view port width so that content remains prominent on all device sizes. 
Position, background and color of jumbrotron changes when viewport width reaches orginal width of hero image and starts to zoom. 
Jumbotron is positioned at bottom of hero image on smaller below this point (against darker part of image for contrast) and changes to a speech bubble design at top left of image (with dark text and white background) after this point.
User is drawn intially to jumbotron on all display sizes as a result. 

* [About me heading](index.html) - three bold headlines to provide user with high level, easy to digest information about me. Consistent high contrast colors, styling and layout on all device sizes. 

* [Main sections of homepage](index.html) - this section is anchored from the call to action button in jumbotron above. Provides a brief summary of each of the main areas of the site (projects, blog, resume) and a link to each as a button styled with bold effects similar to the jumbotron CTA button.
Resume subsection also includes a [link to download a pdf](index.html) of my resume so this option is easily accessible on the homepage for any users who have this specific goal. 
Layout of this section changes from three full-width subsections in one column on mobile view, to one fixed-width column with a surrounding border on tablet, to a one row layout with relevant images added and a border around each subsection on larger displays.

* [Work history section and qualification sections](resume.html) provide clear and concise dates, employer information and descriptions of roles in a reverse-chronological timeline format so users can easily digest information. 
Each section of page (work history, qualifications, skills, about me) has a full width heading box at the top of page with a title containing relevant icon and consistent, contrasting colors. Gives clear feedback to user to find information on the page.
Information is prioritzed and easy for user to find: educational qualifications are displayed first followed by a summary of owner's skills and knowledge of specific technologies as a software developer and a more casual 'about me' section conatining owner's interests, hobbies and achievements and a consistent avatar image displayed.
Sections have a responsive layout to maximize use of available horizontal space and provide more information on viewport where possible. All sections are full width, single column and stacked vertically on mobile views. The employment and qualification sections change to a two column layout on tablet views (each with a border) while skills and about me sections remain full width (but the arrangment of elements within these sections changes to accommodate extra space).
On desktop views the skills section becomes an extra column adjacent to the employments and qualifications section while the about me section remains full width at the bottom of the page (since it has lowest priority).
