* presenting and linking to my blog posts on medium.com
* providing links to my professional social media accounts
* displaying a contact form 

### Link to live site

### Owner's goals

The owner's (my) goals for the site:

* To present my skills, experience, qualifications and abilities in a clear, convenient format to potential
employers and clients. 
* To provide a postive user experience to all users of the site and help establish a postive reputation for myself as
a developer and designer.
* To provide a convenient way for potential employers/clients/collaborators/developers to contact me
so that I increase job opportunities, expand my network and  industry connections.
* To present my projects to potential colaborators and other developers so I increase my followers and collaboration
via GitHub and receive more feedback and suggestions.
* To present a selection of my blog posts primarily to other developers with a similar level of skills
and experience to me; secondly to potential employers to evidence my accomplished communication skills. 

### User goals

Site user goals:

* Potential employer/client looking to hire a junior developer - wants to assess my skills and experience
quickly, get an impression of my ability and areas of strength/weakness, find relevant information about 
qualifications and experience, view my projects and contact me easily.
* Potential collaborator looking to work with a junior developer with relevant skills and experience to their need -
wants to assess my skills and experience quickly, view my previous projects and contact me easily.
* Coding student/learner/enthusiast looking for blog posts relevant to their experience and knowledge levels - 
wants to choose from and view my blog posts easily.
* Other developers who may want to follow me on GitHub or otherwise connect - want to view a summary of my projects
and link to them easily on GitHub, amy also want to contact me to connect. 

## UX

User stories:

* Potential employer/client/collaborator: wants to find out about my qualifications, experience and 
previous projects so they can evaluate my skill level and knowledge relative to the needs of their organization/project. 
* Potential employer/client/collaborator: wishes to contact me or to connect with me online so they can make
an enquiry about a job/project.
* Coding student/learner/enthusiast: wants to browse and read my blog posts and view my projects to potentially learn more 
about a topic that interests them, or get ideas/reflections from someone in a similar situation, with similar career goals.  

This site helps it's users to acheive their goals better than other means by:

* Providing a simple, intuitive user interface that facilatiates easy navigation to desired content
* Separating resume, projects and blog features of site to avoid overloading users with information and 
encapsulating what is relevant to them
* Providing easy to find, clear and standardized contact information

The goals of myself (site owner and subject):

* wants to host professional information in a convenient, eyecatching way to attract potential
employer/client/collaborator to hire me or collaborate on a project idea with me. 
* wants to share and host my blog posts so that I can help others learn, communicate and
deepen my understanding about programming concepts and demonstrate my knowledge level and communication skills to 
potential employers/clients/collaborators. 

This site helps the site owner (me) to acheive my goals better than other means by:

* Providing a richer, more engaging, more personalized exposition of my professional credentials, interests and personality than 
a proforma resume hosting site or document
* Demonstrating a clear, pleasant, professional user interface to potential employers/clients to showcase my skills as 
a front end developer
