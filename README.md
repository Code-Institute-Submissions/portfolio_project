A fully responsive, mobile first website:

* displaying my own resume (work history, education, skills, qualifications) 
* linking to my projects
* providing my contact information and social media addresses
* hosting my own blog posts

## UX

Potential site user categories:

* Potential employer/client looking to hire a junior developer
* Potential collaborator looking to work with a junior developer
* Coding student/learner/enthusiast looking for articles and posts relevant to their experience and knowledge

The user categories of my site with their respective user stories:

* Potential employer/client/collaborator: wants to find out about my qualifications, experience and 
previous projects so they can evaluate my skill level and knowledge relative to the needs of their organization/project. 
* Potential employer/client/collaborator: wishes to contact me or to connect with me online so they can make
an enquiry about a job/project.
* Coding student/learner/enthusiast: wants to browse and read my blog posts and view my projects to potentially learn more 
about a topic that interests them, or get ideas/reflections from someone in a similar situation, with similar career goals.  

This site helps it's users to acheive their goals better than other means by:

* Providing a simple, intuitive user interface that facilatiates easy navigation to desired content
* Separating resume, projects and blog features of site to avoid overloading users with information and 
encapsulating what is relevant to them
* Providing easy to find, clear and standardized contact information
* Providing a deeper, more engaging exposition of my professional credentials, interests and personality than 
a proforma resume hosting site or document


The goals of myself (site owner and subject):

* wants to host professional information in a convenient, eyecatching way to attract potential
employer/client/collaborator to hire me or collaborate on a project idea with me. 
* wants to share and host my blog posts so that I can help others learn, communicate and
deepen my understanding about programming concepts and demonstrate my knowledge level and communication skills to 
potential employers/clients/collaborators.

## Features

### Across site

* Header - including responsive navigation menu and site logo. Allows all users to navigate easily, consistenly and quickly
between different pages on the site by having clear, semantic menu options laid out in a standardized, predictable way. 
Provides a way for any user to easily return to home page if 'lost' by clicking the ubiquitous logo link.
Responsive by collapsing into a menu button on smaller device sizes - so that content and functionality of navigation 
menu is consistent across different viewport widths and all users have a similar experience. 

* Footer - including repeated navigation menu links, social media links. Allows users to navigate once they have
scrolled through the main page content without needing to scroll back up. Provides external links in an easy to find
location: intuitively expected by users due to web conventions.
